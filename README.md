# Pandas Homework - Heroes of Pymoli

![Fantasy](Images/Fantasy.png)

In this exercise, I took the role of an analyst for a video gaming company. In their free-to-play game Heroes of Pymoli, players are encouraged to purchase optional items to enhance their experience. 

Please find my insights below:

1. Players under 10 have the second-highest average purchase price ($4.54). It is unlikely that these players have any income stream, and if they do, it certainly is not connected to a credit card for in-game purchases for our app. We should review our paywall to make sure that our youngest players are not racking up bills on their unsuspecting parents. A small, short-term revenue dip is worth their extended relationship with our game -- parents may delete the app in frustration if they are receiving unexpected charges.

2. Interestingly, the gender purchasing rates almost exactly line up with each gender's overall representation in the game. Male players comprise 84% of the player base, and are responsible for 83.6% of purchases.

3. We should not be afraid of listing our in-game purchases in the $4-5 cateogry. Our top 5 most profitable items all fall in this range. Once the code is written, there is no marginal cost for its replication.
