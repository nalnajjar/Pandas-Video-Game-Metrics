OBSERVABLE TRENDS IN HEROES OF PYMOLI

1. Players under 10 have the second-highest average purchase price ($4.54). It is unlikely that these players have any income stream, and if they do, it certainly is not connected to a credit card for in-game purchases for our app. We should review our paywall to make sure that our youngest players are not racking up bills on their unsuspecting parents. A small, short-term revenue dip is worth their extended relationship with our game -- parents may delete the app in frustration if they are receiving unexpected charges.

2. Interestingly, the gender purchasing rates almost exactly line up with each gender's overall representation in the game. Male players comprise 84% of the player base, and are responsible for 83.6% of purchases.

3. We should not be afraid of listing our in-game purchases in the $4-5 cateogry. Our top 5 most profitable items all fall in this range. Once the code is written, there is no marginal cost for its replication. 

* I had some issue with adding $ and % signs, in most instances it added the entire dataframe into each column, instead of the intended value. In these instances I placed the appropriate signs in the column headings.
