#observable trends 

***on my own work, all metrics became standardized and would not represent the bin-specific metrics I was trying to achieve. I could typically get the metrics I wanted on the groupby, but then I couldn't add them back into the groupby so that they could be displayed in a table. To complete this written portion of the homework, I went back to the original homework assignment and viewed those charts.


1. It appears that student achievement is inverse to the amount of money spent on the student. For example, for those schools with spending ranges below $585, the passing rate is 95%. However, for schools between $645-675, the overall passing rate is 73%. 

2. Charter schools appear to vastly outperform district schools, with their respective overall passing rates at 95% to 73%.
